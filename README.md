Hello there! Before talking about qualifications and professional abilities, I would like to introduce myself. I am Marko Beloica and I am from Serbia. I am software developer. I strive to develop quality software, very passionate about computer science and software. I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me. I believe that people should do things in which they are good at or in which their heart lays. That’s why I chose software development as my career because I believe I’m good at this and I am always honest and never afraid of doing hard work. Highly skilled in testing, and developing software and thorough understanding of data structures and algorithms.

I am currently employed by ReconengMDS (http://reconeng.com.au/) and ProfiFeed Technologies (https://profistop.com/) as a software developer.
